## Password Generator
Simple Java project to get in to object-oriented programming
## Description
The code generates a GUI where you can create a random password and associate it with a username/email and additional information. The password can be up to 30 characters long, and you can choose whether to include special characters or allow duplicates from the drop-down menu. After filling in all the required fields, you can save the password to a text file, which includes the current time and date. By default, the text file is named "PasswordList". If it's your first time saving a password, the file will be created automatically. Otherwise, if the file already exists in the chosen directory, it will be overwritten without losing previously saved passwords
