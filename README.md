## Passward Generator
Hi, i am new to GitHub and i wanted to share this simple project i made to get familiar with object-oriented programming. Feel free to edit or correct it.
Sorry if I'm not using GitHub correctly <3
## Description
The code generates a GUI where you can create a random password and associate a username/email and information with it. 
The password can be up to 30 characters long and you can choose from the drop-down menu whether to include special or duplicate characters. 
After filling in all the text fields you can save the password in a text file with current time and date. 
By default the text file is called "PasswordList" and if it is the first time you are saving a password, the file will be created automatically, 
otherwise, if the file is already present in the chosen directory, it will only be overwritten, without losing the other saved passwords
## Setup
The setup is very simple, just download the src folder, which contains all the packages and classes, open the directory where you saved the files 
and compile the Main.java from the terminal with the command:
- `javac Main.java`
and run it with the command:
- `java Main`
