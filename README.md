## Password Generator
The code generates a GUI where you can create a random password and associate a username/email and information with it. 
The password can be up to 30 characters long and you can choose from the drop-down menu whether to include special or duplicate characters. 
After filling in all the text fields you can save the password in a text file with current time and date. 
By default the text file is called "PasswordList" and if it is the first time you are saving a password, the file will be created automatically, 
otherwise, if the file is already present in the chosen directory, it will only be overwritten, without losing the other saved passwords
